# Levi-Hickman-Portfolio

## Story <br>
A potential employer will likely want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio. The intention of this portfolio is to present examples of work and projects that the developer has created.

### Requirements ###
* The portfolio should contain the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
* When a link in the navigation bar is clicked, the UI must scroll to the corresponding section on the page.
* The image for the first application should be larger in size than the other application images.
* When the image for the application is clicked, it will link to the correct deployed application.
* When the page is resized, the layout responds and adapts to the different viewpoints.
